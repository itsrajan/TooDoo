# TooDoo    :books:

## What it is    :star:
A locally stored to do list meant for quick use during online school! Most primarily designed to create quick notes that can be accessed with the click of a button!

## Motivation    :crown:
I need a todo list in my life, and I have never found the right one online. I developed TooDoo in order to create one for myself, which I now use on a daily basis.
